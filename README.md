# PoseTrack - The Gym Buddy You Never Knew You Needed 🏋️‍♂️💪

Welcome to PoseTrack, the workout tracker that's more attentive than your gym partner and definitely more fun! Say goodbye to boring workout logs and hello to a fitness journey filled with laughs and precision poses.

## Features 🌟

- **Real-time Pose Estimation**: MediaPose isn't just for selfies anymore! Watch as it accurately tracks your movements, probably better than your reflection in the gym mirror.

- **Comprehensive Workout Logging**: Logging workouts has never been easier. PoseTrack's got your back... and your biceps... and your abs... you get the idea.

- **Exercise Library**: Get ready to flex your exercise knowledge muscles with our extensive library. We've got moves even your grandma hasn't heard of!

- **Custom Workouts**: Personalize your sweat session like never before. Who needs a personal trainer when you've got PoseTrack? (Okay, maybe still keep your trainer... we don't want to hurt their feelings.)

- **Performance Analytics**: See your progress in black and white... and maybe a little pink if you've been slacking. But hey, we won't judge!

- **Visual Feedback**: We're all about keeping it real-time. Get instant feedback on your form, posture, and just how much you're sweating. (Hint: it's probably a lot.)

- **Sync Across Devices**: Because your workout should follow you everywhere, even if you're just lounging on the couch. We won't judge... okay, maybe a little.

- **Privacy and Security**: Your workout secrets are safe with us. Just don't tell anyone about that one time you tried yoga and fell over... multiple times.
